## John James Utley - CS Portfolio

The majority of my projects are pre-college projects and are not commented but I have recently added ReadMe files to them. I mostly make video games in the Unity Game Engine using C#.

### Coursework

#### Nuggets Terminal Video Game
This is a multiplayer video game that me and a small team built in a Software Design and Implementation course. It is built entirely in C and from the ground up. It runs in the terminal. This program involved a lot of network coding and was built in a SCRUM and Sprint style work enviroment.
