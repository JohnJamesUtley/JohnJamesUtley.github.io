# John James Utley - CS Portfolio

The majority of my projects are pre-college projects and are not commented but I have recently added ReadMe files to most of them. I mostly make video games in the Unity Game Engine using C# but some projects are made with C and other languages.

## Coursework

### Nuggets Terminal Video Game
This is a multiplayer video game that me and a small team built in a Software Design and Implementation course. It is built entirely in C and from the ground up. It runs in the terminal. In the game players are placed on a unrevealed premade map. They can only see in their immediate vincinity according to their lines of sight. The goal is for the players to wander around and pick up small gold piles which are randomly placed throughout the map before other players. This program involved a lot of network coding and was built in a SCRUM and Sprint style work enviroment. This project has proper commenting.

## Work
### Panda Doc Receiver
This is a very rough and quick program I wrote for a Business Internship that I had from June 2021 to September 2021. It uses a website's API to export documents in bulk that have been filled out and signed by employees. The website is similar to DocuSign and is not originally designed for so many documents. It runs in terminal and exports to a CSV file. Not Commented
